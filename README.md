## About the code

This is a simple sign up app written in Kotlin. It includes inputs for first name, email address, password and website.
Email and password inputs are required and will display a toast when not filled in. All other fields are optional.
After submission the user is routed to a confirmation view that shows a greeting with their first name, a confirmation message and a display of their confirmation details.
A non-functional sign-in button is present.
