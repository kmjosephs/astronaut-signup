# Among Us crewmate signup app

The Skeld is running low on crewmates! Sign up today to become a part of this awesome crew. Benefits include:

- Beautiful space views

- Pets at work (we are brain slug friendly!)
- Interesting coworkers that keep you on your toes!

## About the code


This is a simple sign up app written in Kotlin. It includes inputs for first name, email address, password and website.

Email and password inputs are required and will display a toast when not filled in. All other fields are optional.

After submission the user is routed to a confirmation view that shows a greeting with their first name, a confirmation message and a display of their confirmation details.

A non-functional sign-in button is present.

## Extra features

- Added accessibility. This app is compatible with the TalkBack screen reader provided by Android. All fields have hints for the reader and images have content descriptions. (Non-functional images don't need it but I included it as an example)
- Material theme to provide a uniform UI/UX experience
